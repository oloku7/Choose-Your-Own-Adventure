# Lab 2 - Choose Your Own Adventure!

We're going to be using Replit Assignments for our labs, just like we do for our in-class problems and homeworks. Like in-class problems (and unlike homeworks), your labs will **not** be graded for correctness.

You will be split into groups at the beginning of the lab, and you'll remain in those groups and work together on the problems until the end of the lab. Work as a team to solve the problems - everyone in your group should be contributing in some way towards the solutions, and everyone in your group should ultimately submit the same solutions. **List the members of your group in the comment at the top of the main.py file.**

Please submit whatever you have at the end of lab so that we can see what everyone came up with. There is no need to finish all of the content. Getting an honest view of what everyone did will help us make the class better for all of you, and you get no benefit from turning in a lab with more problems solved if you don't understand them. 

## Instructions
You and your group will design and program a *Choose Your Own Adventure Game*! This is purely a text-based adventure game where the player progresses to different scenerios based on their ability to choose from a limited set of choices. 

You must provide the player at least 2 different choices in at least 2 different parts of the adventure.

* Think about what those choices will be. For example, the program could prompt the user to choose which door to enter, or choose which enemy to fight, or choose which teasure chest to open, or which item to select.
* Think about how those choices will be presented to user (via the terminal), and how the user's choice will be retrieved and stored.
* Think about how to use conditionals (if/else statements) to change what scenerios/outcomes are presented to user.

## Example Game Playthrough:
Here is an example of a game I created. I'll show two different playthroughs, and take note on how the output changes based on the choices made:

**Play Through 1:**

    Welcome to choose your own adventure game!

    You killed the Ogre! Only super long range or powerful close range weapons could do the job!
